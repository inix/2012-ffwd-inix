2012.FFWD is a high performance theme based on Twenty Twelve.

== Description ==
2012.FFWD is based on Twenty Twelve, but is optimized for optimal performance. Like Twenty Twelve it is a fully responsive theme that looks great on any device. Features include a front page template with its own widgets, an optional display font, styling for post formats on both index and single views, and an optional no-sidebar page template. Make it yours with a custom menu, header image, and background.

Main changes when compared to Twenty Twelve:
* No webfonts downloaded
* style.css minimized
* navigation.js minimized and inlined

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the font different from the one used in Twenty Twelve =

2012.FFWD strives to be first in class when it comes to performance. In that context the use of webfonts is counter-productive.

= Why do you put javascript in the HTML? =

navigation.js is a 8K download in the original Twenty Twelve theme. After minimizing the size was that small, that from a performance point of view it is better inline it to avoid the request/ response overhead.
